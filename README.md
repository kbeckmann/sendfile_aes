# sendfile_aes
Experimental/exploratory linux kernel module that offers a sendfile()-variant with AES-encryption. Its current state is barely a prototype and will probably crash your machine sooner or later. Only try this at the risk of getting a kernel panic and so on.

This is currently 100% WORK IN PROGRESS :).
